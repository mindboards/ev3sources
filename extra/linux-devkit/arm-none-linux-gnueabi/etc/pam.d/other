#
# /etc/pam.d/other - specify the PAM fallback behaviour
#
# Note that this file is used for any unspecified service; for example
#if /etc/pam.d/cron  specifies no session modules but cron calls
#pam_open_session, the session module out of /etc/pam.d/other is
#used.  

#If you really want nothing to happen then use pam_permit.so or
#pam_deny.so as appropriate.

# We use pam_warn.so to generate syslog notes that the 'other'
#fallback rules are being used (as a hint to suggest you should setup
#specific PAM rules for the service and aid to debugging). We then 
#fall back to the system default in /etc/pam.d/common-*
