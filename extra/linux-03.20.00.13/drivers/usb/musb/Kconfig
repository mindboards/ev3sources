	  Say Y here if your system has a dual role high speed USB
	  controller based on the Mentor Graphics silicon IP.  Then
	  configure options to match your silicon and the board
	  it's being used with, including the USB peripheral role,
	  or the USB host role, or both.

	  Texas Instruments familiies using this IP include DaVinci
	  (35x, 644x ...), OMAP 243x, OMAP 3, and TUSB 6010.

	  Analog Devices parts using this IP include Blackfin BF54x,
	  BF525 and BF527.

	  If you do not know what this is, please say N.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here; the
	  module will be called "musb_hdrc".

	  Dual-Role devices can support both host and peripheral roles,
	  as well as a the special "OTG Device" role which can switch
	  between both roles as needed.

	  If it has a USB "A" (rectangular), "Mini-A" (uncommon),

	help
	   This config is for enabling support for Host, Device modes on
	   single kernel image.  This differs from OTG config in not
	   supporting HNP, SRP.  VBUS status is sensed perodically to switch
	   to Host mode on reception of connect interrupt.  Products typically
	   need this functionality were in the boards do not have the related
	   OTG compliant circutry but rather support either Host or Device
	   modes on the same Mini/Micro -AB port or on seperate A and B ports.

	select USB_OTG
	help
	   The most notable feature of USB OTG is support for a
	   "Dual-Role" device, which can act as either a device
	   or a host.  The initial role choice can be changed
	   later, when two dual-role devices talk to each other.

	   At this writing, the OTG support in this driver is incomplete,
	   omitting the mandatory HNP or SRP protocols.  However, some
	   of the cable based role switching works.  (That is, grounding
	   the ID pin switches the controller to host mode, while leaving
	   it floating leaves it in peripheral mode.)

	   Select this if your system has a Mini-AB connector, or
	   to simplify certain kinds of configuration.

	   To implement your OTG Targeted Peripherals List (TPL), enable
	   USB_OTG_WHITELIST and update "drivers/usb/core/otg_whitelist.h"
	   to match your requirements.
